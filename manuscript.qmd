## Abstract

We study how Swiss media report on feminicide and related forms of gendered
violence. Using the Swissdox@LiRI API, we compile a large corpus of German-
language media articles (1990–present) and apply quantitative text analysis
to identify shifts in terminology and framing over time.

## Project Context

This project is part of the seminar **Computational Social Science** and is
supervised by **Rudy Farys** and **Achim Edelmann**.

## Research Questions

- How does the vocabulary used to describe feminicide change over time?
- Which terms become more or less prominent in later periods?
- How do action and relation terms co-occur in reporting?

## Data

We access Swiss media articles via the Swissdox@LiRI API. The dataset includes
article metadata and full-text content in German. The second-pass query is
restricted to 1990–present to ensure manageable volume and consistency.

## Methods

We use a two-stage query strategy and text preprocessing based on quanteda.
For diachronic analysis, we combine normalized term usage over time with
key-term contrasts between early and late periods.

## Results

Results are reported in the accompanying analysis notebook.

## Limitations and Ethics

We discuss limitations of media coverage as a proxy for real-world incidence
and reflect on ethical considerations in handling sensitive content.

## Appendix

All code and intermediate checkpoints are stored in the project repository.
